# Development Workflow Rules

## Core Principle: NO BUILD OR DEV COMMANDS

**Never run build or development server commands. Always assume the dev environment is running.**

### Forbidden Commands
- ❌ `npm run dev` / `yarn dev` / `pnpm dev`
- ❌ `npm run build` / `yarn build` / `pnpm build`
- ❌ `npm start` / `yarn start` / `pnpm start`
- ❌ `turbo run dev` / `turbo run build`
- ❌ Any server startup commands

### Assumptions
- ✅ Development server is ALWAYS running
- ✅ Hot reload is active and working
- ✅ User manages their own development environment
- ✅ Focus on code changes, not process management

### Allowed Verification Commands
- ✅ `npm run lint` - Static analysis
- ✅ `npm run type-check` - TypeScript validation
- ✅ `npm run test` - Unit tests
- ✅ File system operations (read, write, edit)
- ✅ Code analysis and search tools

### When User Requests Build/Dev
If user explicitly asks to run build or dev:
1. Clarify if they want to run it themselves
2. Only run if they explicitly confirm with phrases like:
   - "please run build"
   - "run the build command"
   - "start the dev server"

### Response Patterns
Instead of suggesting builds, offer:
- Code improvements and fixes
- Static analysis results
- Architecture recommendations
- Implementation guidance

**The user manages their development environment. Focus on code, not processes.**
