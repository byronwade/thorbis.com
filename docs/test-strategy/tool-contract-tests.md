# Thorbis Tool Contract Tests

Comprehensive test suite for all AI tools in the Thorbis system, covering input validation, output formats, error handling, and edge cases.

## Test Framework Structure

### Test Categories
- **Happy Path**: Valid inputs with expected outputs
- **Edge Cases**: Boundary conditions and unusual but valid inputs
- **Error Scenarios**: Invalid inputs and system failures
- **Security Tests**: Authorization, tenant isolation, input sanitization
- **Performance Tests**: Response times, rate limits, resource usage
