# Thorbis Chaos Engineering Drills

Comprehensive chaos engineering test suite for validating system resilience during external service outages, with defined fallback behaviors, user-visible messages, and recovery procedures.

## Chaos Engineering Framework

### Testing Philosophy
- **Graceful Degradation**: Core functionality continues during service outages
- **Clear Communication**: Users understand what's happening and next steps
- **Automatic Recovery**: System self-heals when services return
- **Data Integrity**: No data loss during failures and recovery
- **Business Continuity**: Critical operations remain available

### Drill Categories
- **Payment Service Outages**: Stripe, payment processors
- **Integration Failures**: QuickBooks, external accounting systems
- **AI Service Disruptions**: Voyage (RAG), v0 (templates)
- **Infrastructure Failures**: Database, CDN, email services
- **Cascading Failures**: Multiple services failing simultaneously
- **Network Partitions**: Partial connectivity scenarios

### Execution Framework
- **Controlled Environment**: Staging environment with production data patterns
- **Gradual Impact**: Start with low-impact scenarios, escalate complexity
- **Monitoring Coverage**: Full observability during chaos experiments
- **Rollback Capability**: Immediate restoration if needed
- **Post-Drill Analysis**: Detailed review of behavior and improvements
