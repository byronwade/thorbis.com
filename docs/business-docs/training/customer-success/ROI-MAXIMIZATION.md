```

### ROI Calculation Methodologies
```yaml
Financial ROI Calculations:
  Basic ROI Formula:
    ROI = (Benefits - Costs) / Costs × 100%
    Example: ($2.4M - $700K) / $700K = 243% ROI
    
  Net Present Value (NPV):
    NPV = Σ(Benefits - Costs) / (1 + discount rate)^year
    Positive NPV indicates profitable investment
    Higher NPV indicates superior investment option
    
  Internal Rate of Return (IRR):
    IRR = Discount rate where NPV = 0
    Higher IRR indicates better investment performance
    Compare to cost of capital for viability
    
  Payback Period:
    Payback = Initial Investment / Annual Cash Flow
    Shorter payback indicates faster value realization
    Risk-adjusted for implementation uncertainty

Risk-Adjusted ROI:
  Probability-Weighted Returns:
    Expected ROI = Σ(Probability × Scenario ROI)
    Conservative: 70% probability, 200% ROI
    Most Likely: 85% probability, 340% ROI
    Optimistic: 95% probability, 480% ROI
    
  Sensitivity Analysis:
    Best Case: All benefits realized, costs minimized
    Base Case: Expected benefits and costs
    Worst Case: Delayed benefits, cost overruns
    Break-even: Minimum required performance
    
  Monte Carlo Simulation:
    Variable input distributions
    Thousands of scenario iterations
    Probability distribution of outcomes
    Risk assessment and mitigation planning
```
