# Deployment Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive deployment guides, infrastructure configuration, and operational procedures for deploying and maintaining Thorbis Business OS applications in production environments.

## Overview

The Thorbis Business OS deployment architecture is designed for scalability, reliability, and performance. Our deployment strategy leverages modern cloud infrastructure, containerization, and automated CI/CD pipelines to ensure consistent, reliable deployments across all environments.

### Deployment Philosophy

## Environment Strategy

### Environment Hierarchy

```typescript
interface DeploymentEnvironment {
  name: 'development' | 'staging' | 'production'
  purpose: string
  infrastructure: InfrastructureConfig
  security: SecurityConfig
  monitoring: MonitoringConfig
}

const environments: DeploymentEnvironment[] = [
  {
    name: 'development',
    purpose: 'Local development and feature testing',
    infrastructure: {
      hosting: 'local',
      database: 'local-supabase',
      cdn: 'disabled'
