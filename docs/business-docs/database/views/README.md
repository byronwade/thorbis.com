## Overview

This directory contains database view definitions that provide query optimization, data abstraction, and simplified data access for applications and reporting.

## View Categories

- **Business Views** - Industry-specific business logic views
- **Reporting Views** - Pre-aggregated data for analytics
- **Security Views** - Filtered and masked data views
- **Integration Views** - API-ready data presentations
- **Administrative Views** - System monitoring and management

## Performance

Views are optimized for common query patterns and include proper indexing support. Materialized views are used for expensive aggregations that don't require real-time data.
