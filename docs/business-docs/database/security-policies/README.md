## Overview

This directory contains Row Level Security (RLS) policies and access control definitions that enforce multi-tenant data isolation and role-based permissions.

## Policy Types

- **Tenant Isolation Policies** - Multi-tenant data separation
- **Role-Based Policies** - User role and permission enforcement
- **Industry-Specific Policies** - Business-specific access rules
- **Time-Based Policies** - Temporal access restrictions
- **Data Sensitivity Policies** - Protection for sensitive information

## Implementation

All tenant-related tables have RLS enabled with appropriate policies. Policies are tested thoroughly to ensure proper access control without performance degradation.
