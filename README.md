## 🌐 The AWS of Local Services

Thorbis is a comprehensive **multi-platform ecosystem** that serves as the digital infrastructure for local service economies worldwide. The platform combines four interconnected components: **LocalHub** (white-label directory creation), **Thorbis Academy** (advanced learning management), **Professional Network** (industry-focused careers), and **Business Management Tools** (industry-specific SaaS solutions) – all powered by AI and real-time cloud architecture.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Set up environment variables (see docs/environment-setup.md)
cp .env.example .env.local

# Run development server (optimized with Turbopack)
bun run dev

# Build for production
bun run build

# Start production server
bun run start

# Development performance tools
bun run dev:optimize    # Clean and optimize development environment
bun run dev:monitor     # Check development performance status
bun run dev:clean       # Quick cache cleanup
```
